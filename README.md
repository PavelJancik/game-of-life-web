This game combine Conway's Game of Life and Langton's Ant. This game differs in grid size, as it is not infinite, some patterns behave other way than in original game. Due to small resolution of the grid, the ant will not come to the state, where he can create highways. However you can use him to create initial state for Game of Life.

## Description

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game consists of a grid of cells that evolve through generations according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells.

## Features

- Interactive grid
- Customizable initial state
- Step-by-step or automatic simulation

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/game_of_life.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Run the application according to the instructions in your chosen language/environment.
